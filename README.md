## What is DreamTable?

DreamTable aims to bring the feel of a digital tabletop session to a standalone game — custom maps, animated character tokens, turn-based grid combat, and free-roam exploration. Think of it as the game *inside* your TTRPG session.

**Engine:** Unity 6 (URP)
**Genre:** Top-down tactical RPG
**Status:** Early development
